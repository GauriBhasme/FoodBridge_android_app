# FoodBridge – Connecting Surplus Food to Those in Need
## 📌 Problem Statement
Food wastage and hunger exist side by side.
Every day, restaurants, households, and events discard surplus food, while NGOs and shelters struggle to provide meals to people in need.
The challenge is lack of a simple, real-time platform that:
Connects food donors with nearby NGOs
Ensures food safety checks
Allows location-based pickup coordination
FoodBridge solves this gap by creating a digital bridge between donors and NGOs to reduce food waste and fight hunger efficiently.
